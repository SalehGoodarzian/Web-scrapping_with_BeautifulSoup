### BeautifulSoup_exercise:
#### We would like to extract information of a movie from Wikipedia, that is a table on the right hand side. We cover a range of Python & data science topics, such as:
    Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
    Cleaning data
    Pattern matching with regular expressions (re library)
    Working with dates (datetime library)


### BeautifulSoup_main_project:
#### Now we first find the links for all movies in the Wikipedia page for Walt Disney Pictures Films. Then, apply the above task of extracting information for their corresponding Wikiperdia page. This will be repeating the above procedure for more 400 times as there are more than 400 movies in the Walt Disney Wikipedia webpage


### Acknowledgement:
#### I have followed the work done in the following YouTube video which I found very educational. I tried to answer the questions myself and write codes in my way. I really acknowledge and appreciate Keith Gally for creating such a great educational video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewgy-G9cmbg)
